# Task-4

In this task, a variety of Python scripts were created to practice conditional logic (if, elif, else). The programs cover real-life scenarios such as:

Leveling based on experience points

Mathematical function evaluation depending on input

Admission and scholarship eligibility

Grade-based feedback

Matching numbers detection

Apartment suitability check

Parcel pickup time windows

Each script takes user input and uses conditionals to output the correct result or message. This task strengthens understanding of logical operators (and, or), comparison operators, and nested conditions.
